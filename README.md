# Jonatas Sas

## Backend & Full Stack Developer

Backend and Full Stack Developer with 21+ years of experience designing and maintaining enterprise-grade systems across banking, fintech, e-commerce, SaaS, and real estate sectors.

I specialize in backend architecture, secure API design, and system performance optimization — delivering robust solutions for mission-critical environments with high availability and low downtime requirements. I’ve also developed backends for high-traffic mobile applications and distributed platforms.

Currently working remotely with international teams to build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready systems that support real business operations.

**Core Expertise:**

* **Languages & Frameworks:** PHP (Laravel, Yii2, Magento, WordPress, etc.), Go, Python, Node.js (JavaScript)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, Angular)
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, etc.
* **Domains:** Backend Architecture, Microservices Design, API Development, CI/CD, Test Automation, Secure Coding, Infrastructure Automation, Legacy Modernization, System Hardening, Performance Optimization, SEO Implementation & Audits, Security Reviews

Although I specialize in backend systems, I’m also comfortable working across the full stack when needed — including modern frontend frameworks, CMS platforms like WordPress, and integration-heavy environments.

Committed to code quality, reliability, and long-term maintainability — applying robust testing strategies, automated pipelines, and architectural rigor to ensure consistent delivery.
